## R Markdown
# Exercise 8
I know the markdown is messy, but I was trying to focus mostly on the code rather than the formatting. I will keep in mind formatting in future projects.

## 1. Load data
```{r load_data}
schools <- read.csv(here::here("Northwestern_Work/R_Bootcamp/MSIA Bootcamp/data/nys_schools.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
counties <- read.csv(here::here("Northwestern_Work/R_Bootcamp/MSIA Bootcamp/data/nys_acs.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

## 2. Exploring Data

```{r explore}

#quick look at the structure of each dataset
head(schools)
head(counties)

#see the number of rows and columns we have total
dim(schools)
dim(counties)

#see all column data types
str(schools)
str(counties)

#see descriptive statistics
summary(schools)
summary(counties)
```
It appears all text columns are "chr", whereas all numerical columns are "num" or "int" which is what we want when looking at the column data types. It also appears there is some missing data since there are "-99" values in all of the numerical columns somewhere in the schools dataset when looking at summary statistics of the columns. -99 does not make sense as a percentage, math score, etc. so it must be being used as a missing value holder.

It also seems there's a wide variety of sizes on enrolled students and mean math scores across the different schools. Percentage of students qualifying for free lunch is much higher across the board that students qualifying for reduced price lunch. County statistics vary widely as well.

## 3. Recoding Data
```{r recode}

#remove rows with missing values
schools = schools[schools$total_enroll != -99,]
schools = schools[schools$mean_ela_score != -99,]
schools = schools[schools$mean_math_score != -99,]
summary(schools)

#create data tables
library(data.table)
schools_dt <- data.table(schools)
counties_dt <- data.table(counties)

#create poverty group column using quartiles
counties_dt$country_per_poverty <- NA
counties_dt[, poverty_level := ifelse(county_per_poverty <= .10903, "Low",
                                ifelse(county_per_poverty <= .14929, "Medium",
                                ifelse(county_per_poverty > .14929, "High", NA)))]
  
head(counties_dt)
str(counties_dt)

#Scale math and reading scores within each year for all schools

```
A categorical poverty variable was created for each country where the bottom quartile of counties in percent poverty were considered to have a "Low" poverty level, the middle two quartiles were considered "Medium", and the highest quartile considered "High" poverty counties.

## 4. Merge Datasets

```{r merge}
#group schools at the county level and get a rough estimate of county aggregations
group_schools <- schools_dt[, .(sum(total_enroll), mean(per_free_lunch), mean(per_reduced_lunch), mean(per_lep), mean(mean_ela_score), mean(mean_math_score)), by = c("county_name", "year")]
setnames(group_schools, c("county_name", "year", "total_enrolled", "mean_per_free_lunch", "mean_per_reduced_lunch", "mean_per_lep", "mean_ela_score", "mean_math_score"))
head(group_schools)

#merge county and school information into one dataset
merged_dt = group_schools[counties_dt, on = c("county_name", "year")]
head(merged_dt)
```
## 5. Create Summary Tables
```{r summary}
#create a table that shows percentage of students qualifying for free/reduced lunch and poverty percentage per county in the most recent year, 2016
county_summary2016 <- merged_dt[year == 2016,.(county_name, year, mean_per_free_lunch+mean_per_reduced_lunch,county_per_poverty)]
setnames(county_summary2016, "V3", "per_free/reduced_lunch")
head(county_summary2016)

#counties with top and bottom 5 poverty rate
county_pov_worst2016 <- merged_dt[year == 2016,.(county_name, year, mean_per_free_lunch+mean_per_reduced_lunch,county_per_poverty, mean_ela_score, mean_math_score)]
setnames(county_pov_worst2016, "V3", "per_free/reduced_lunch")
ordered_county <- county_pov_worst2016[order(county_per_poverty)]
#lowest 5 county poverty levels
head(ordered_county[1:5,])
#highest 5 county poverty levels
head(ordered_county[(nrow(ordered_county)-4):nrow(ordered_county),])
```
